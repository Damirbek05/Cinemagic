# Cinemagic MERN Stack Project
Welcome to Cinemagic, a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Cinemagic leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience for exploring movies and TV shows.
## Introduction
Cinemagic is a platform that allows users to discover information about movies and TV shows, including details like cast, crew, reviews, and more. The project is built on the MERN stack, combining the power of MongoDB for database storage, Express.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js for server-side scripting. The TMDB API integration enriches the application with a vast database of movie and TV show information.
